SSH (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a network protocol for securing data that flows between a client and server over a network. The SSH protocol  is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. Whenever a client connects to a server, it needs to be verified so that the connection made is secure.

This secured connection is established on the basis of a cryptographic key (SSH key). The connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server. The main use of key-based authentication is to enable secure automation.

Once a connection has been established between the SSH client and server, the data that is transmitted is encrypted according to the parameters negotiated in the setup.

One immediate advantage this method has over traditional password authentication is that you can be authenticated by the server without ever having to send your password over the network.
