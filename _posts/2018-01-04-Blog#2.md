title: Intel core i3, i5 & i7.. ||Explained||

![Emerald](img/intelcore.png "Emerald")
What exactly are these core i3 , i5 & i7 processors ? This question must have crossed your mind at some point of time while using your desktop/laptop
or while buying a new one. Intel Core is a line of mid-to-high end consumer, workstation, and enthusiast central processing units (CPU) marketed by
Intel Corporation.<br />
To set the record straight, we can say that Core i7s are better than Core i5s, which are in turn better than Core i3s. <br />
On the other hand , Core i7 does not have
 seven cores nor does Core i3 have three cores. The numbers are simply indicative of their relative processing powers.

So, these 3 types can be classified as:

Core i3 : Basic users. Economic choice. Good for browsing the web, using Microsoft office, making video calls, and social networking. Not for gamers or professionals.<br />
<br />
Core i5 : Intermediate users. Those who want balance between performance and price.<br />
<br />
Core i7 : Professionals. This is one of the best processors offered by intel.Good for all kinds of tasks including most of the heavy games also.


These 3 processors under the brand name of Intel core are further divided into 7 generations, namely :<br />


--Nehalem microarchitecture-based<br />
--Sandy Bridge (2nd gen) microarchitecture-based<br />
--Ivy Bridge (3rd gen)<br />
--Haswell (4th gen)<br />
--Broadwell (5th gen)<br />
--Skylake (6th gen)<br />
--Kaby Lake (7th gen)<br />

For the most part, you'll get faster CPU performance from Core i7 than Core i5 and core i3. The majority of Core i7 desktop CPUs are quad-core processors, as are the majority of Core i5 desktop CPUs, while the core i3's are dual core. Their relative levels of processing power are based on a collection of criteria involving their number of cores, clock speed (in GHz), size of cache, as well as technologies like Turbo Boost 2.0 and Hyper-Threading.<br />

These technologies add extra processing power to CPU even if it is lower end processor with fewer number of cores.

``Turbo Boost 2.0``: Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.01 accelerates processor and graphics performance for peak loads, automatically allowing processor cores
	     to run faster than the rated operating frequency if they’re operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits.

``Hyperthreading`` : Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) uses processor resources more efficiently, enabling multiple threads to run on each core.
		A thread  is merely an ordered sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do. In layman terms we can say that more number of threads
corresponds to more number of operations taking place simultaneously.

``Cache Size``  : Apart from Hyper-Threading and Turbo Boost, the one other major difference in the Core line-up is Cache Size. Cache is basically a smaller and faster memory, closer to a processor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. Larger the size of cache in the processor, the faster the speed. The Core i3 series typically has up to 3 MB of cache. The Core i5 series has between 3 MB and 6 MB of cache. The Core i7 series has between 4 MB and 8 MB of cache.

**So, which one should you buy ?**<br />
<br />
-Core i3 processors aren’t as fast or powerful as Core i5 processors, but they’re more than capable of running the vast majority of standard computer programs with ease, i.e. they are sufficiently powerful for any casual user.<br />

-If you plan to use your computer for high-end 3D gaming, media editing, or 4K video playback, you want all the processing power you can get. The extra expense and power draw of a Core i5 processor is worth the upgrade, especially when paired with more powerful components like extra RAM or a discrete graphics card. </br>

-A Core i7 makes sense only for users who don’t mind paying a premium for more power, or users who often run extremely demanding software. It provides the best graphics, speed, power and overall performance. It's basically the best CPUs you can have, regardless of how extreme you are.

**My 2 Cents on the topic -**<br />
<br />
For most of the users, an i5 processor would be the best bang for the buck. Apart from its support for daily routines such as browsing or creating and editing Microsoft Office documents, Core i5 works well for gaming and heavy usage, which involves using many applications at the same time without experiencing glitches or freezing.
It is also very good when it comes to programming and normal editing tasks.
