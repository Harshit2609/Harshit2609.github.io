The "Internet of things" (IoT) has become the Buzzword in the tech world in the past few years. The idea behind IOT in itself a game changer and effects the way in which  we live our daily lives. But what exactly is the "Internet of things" and what impact is it going to have on you, if any? <br />

IoT is basically a system of Machines which  are connected to each other to form a network of devices. All these machines have the ability to collect large amounts of data
and also share this data among themselves and further transport it to say a  data analysis center.  <br />

With an Intranet of Things, apps are deployed for a specific purpose and don’t interact outside of that network. The true IoT is where different applications are deployed for specific reasons and the data collected from the machines and objects being monitored are made available to third-party applications.


**Characterstics Of IoT ?**<br />
<br />
There are 7 crucial Internet of Things characteristics:
1)  Connectivity. This doesn’t need much further explanation. Devices, sensors, they need to be connected: to an item, to each other, actuators, a process and to ‘the Internet’ or another network.
2)  Things. Anything that can be tagged or connected as such as it’s designed to be connected. From sensors and household appliances to tagged livestock. Devices can contain sensors or sensing materials can be attached to devices and items.
3)  Data. Data is the glue of the Internet of Things, the first step towards action and intelligence.
4)  Communication. Devices get connected so they can communicate data and this data can be analyzed.
5)  Intelligence. The aspect of intelligence as in the sensing capabilities in IoT devices and the intelligence gathered from data analytics (also artificial intelligence).
6)  Action. The consequence of intelligence. This can be manual action, action based upon debates regarding phenomena (for instance in climate change decisions) and automation, often the most important piece.
7)  Ecosystem. The place of the Internet of Things from a perspective of other technologies, communities, goals and the picture in which the Internet of Things fits. The Internet of Everything dimension, the platform dimension and the need for solid partnerships.

**Pros of IoT -**<br />
<br />
``Increased Productivity`` : IoT network benefits not one but all i.e. individuals, society, stake holders of businesses etc. due to the fact that IoT network saves time and money. IoT systems delivers faster and accurately with minimum utilization of energy. This improves quality of life.

``Security`` : IoT concept is used in home security devices which are monitored and controlled either locally or remotely using easy to use applications available on mobile phones or smartphones. Typical IoT devices are security alarm, Camera, sensors, door lock etc. are used in home automation environment.

``Smart Environment`` :A very important application of IoT is detecting pollution and natural calamities. We can monitor the emissions from factories and vehicles to minimize air pollution. We can track the release of harmful chemicals and waste in rivers and the sea, thereby arresting water pollution.


``Smarter Devices`` : Consumers are waiting for smarter generations of wearables and Internet of Things products, which are able to fulfil more functions without being too dependent from smartphones, as is the case with many of such devices today (think the first generations of smartwatches, which need a smartphone).  


**Cons of IoT -**<br />
<br />
``Safety``: There is a chance that the software can be hacked and your personal information misused. The possibilities are endless. Your prescription being changed or your account details being hacked could put you at risk. Hence, all the safety risks become the consumer’s responsibility.

``Complexity level`` : The IoT is a diverse and complex network. Any failure or bugs in the software or hardware will have serious consequences. Even power failure can cause a lot of inconvenience.

``Compatibility and Data Integration`` : A huge number of interconnected devices and hundreds of service provider companies. Having hundreds of standards worsen the condition. As of now, it is not decided whether the devices would have single set of standards or these standards vary according to the service providers.
