What exactly are these core i3,i5 n i7 processors ? This question must have crossed your mind at some point of time while using your desktop/laptop
or while buying a new one. Intel Core is a line of mid-to-high end consumer, workstation, and enthusiast central processing units (CPU) marketed by
Intel Corporation.
To set the record straight, we can say that Core i7s are better than Core i5s, which are in turn better than Core i3s. Core i7 does not have
 seven cores nor does Core i3 have three cores. The numbers are simply indicative of their relative processing powers.

So, these 3 types can be classified as:

Core i3: Basic users. Economic choice. Good for browsing the web, using Microsoft office, making video calls, and social networking. Not for gamers or professionals.
Core i5: Intermediate users. Those who want balance between performance and price.
Core i7: Professionals. This is one of the best processors offered by intel.Good for all kinds of tasks including most of the heavy games also.


These 3 processors under the brand name of Intel core are further divided into 7 generations, namely :


-Nehalem microarchitecture-based
-Sandy Bridge (2nd gen) microarchitecture-based
-Ivy Bridge (3rd gen)
-Haswell (4th gen)
-Broadwell (5th gen)
-Skylake (6th gen)
-Kaby Lake (7th gen)

For the most part, you'll get faster CPU performance from Core i7 than Core i5 and core i3. The majority of Core i7 desktop CPUs are quad-core processors, as are the majority of Core i5 desktop CPUs, while the core i3's are dual core.Their relative levels of processing power are based on a collection of criteriainvolving their number of cores, clock speed (in GHz), size of cache, as well as technologies like Turbo Boost 2.0 and Hyper-Threading.
These technologies add extra processing power to CPU even if it is lower end processor with fewer number of cores.

``Turbo Boost 2.0``: Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.01 accelerates processor and graphics performance for peak loads, automatically allowing processor cores
	     to run faster than the rated operating frequency if they’re operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits.

``Hyperthreading``: Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) uses processor resources more efficiently, enabling multiple threads to run on each core.
		A thread  is merely an ordered sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do. In layman terms we can say that more number of threads
corresponds to more number of operations taking place simultaneously.
