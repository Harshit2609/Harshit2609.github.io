title: Google's safe driving tool protects over 3 billion devices.
---
Google today announced that its Safe Browsing service, which keeps Chrome, Safari and Firefox users on the desktop and on mobile from visiting potentially dangerous sites, now protects more than 3 billion devices.
The service, one of Google’s first attempts at an anti-malware tool, first launched as a feature of the company’s flagship search engine on the desktop back in 2007. Since then, both Safari and Firefox have adopted the service, in addition to many web and app developers (including the likes of Snapchat).
